```{r, echo=FALSE}
hook_plot <- knit_hooks$get('plot')
knit_hooks$set(plot=function(x, options) {
    if (!is.null(options$pelican.publish) && options$pelican.publish) {
        x <- paste0("{filename}", x)
    }
    hook_plot(x, options)
})
opts_chunk$set(fig.path='../content/figure/',echo=TRUE, warning=TRUE, message=TRUE)
opts_chunk$set(pelican.publish=FALSE)


# It took me a second to figure out pelican.publish=TRUE. #If you're writing in RStudio and want to see local output, #set that to FALSE. But if you are ready to run pelican #content and publish to the web, that should be TRUE.
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R **code** that generated the plot.

what else?
####small heading
and 
#here a large *one*
but probably more interesting would be 
this `git is good`
or this:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```

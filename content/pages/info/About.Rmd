## running time: 1.71438578367233
## we selected 2nd SF step for all trials
## SF step: 2, sub-movements: 0
## we padded with 10 frames on the left&right sides for boundary effects
## mallAngl, mallCent, mallEvent were updated to the selected time interval
## mallAngl_alig, mallCent_alig, mallEvent_alig are dtw alighned after (centerRFoot_2+centerLFoot_2)
## InBowStance has selected time intervals for Left to Right BS for alighned data
## mallAnglD, mallCentD are downsampled (frd=15) and not aligned
## mallAngl_aligD, mallCent_aligD are downsampled and aligned

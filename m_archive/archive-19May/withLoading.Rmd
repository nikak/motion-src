#I think only if you had SSH and fab publish is working
#But if you are ready to run pelican content and publish to the web, that should be TRUE. 
#And figure path is different

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R **code** that generated the plot.

***ok*, that is bold**

what else?
####small heading
and 
#here a large *one*
but probably more interesting would be 
this `git is good`
or this:
```
git status
git add
git commit
